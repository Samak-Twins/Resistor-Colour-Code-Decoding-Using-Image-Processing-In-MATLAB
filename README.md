# Resistor-Colour-Code-Decoding-Using-Image-Processing-In-MATLAB
The aim of this project is to decode the colour bands of a resistor by image processing and display the value of the resistance. 
The project uses MATLAB R2015a in order to edit and compile the program. The built-in image processing module is used for the purpose. 
The program is useful to calculate resistance values for 4 band resistors only; however, can be easily modified in future as per the requirements. 
Also, it doesnâ€™t take into account the tolerance band as it is different from other bands (not responsible for the value of the resistance) and is also easy to decode.
